Sevillatatis is a web application designed to help users discover and book unique activities in the beautiful city of Seville. From guided tours of the iconic Alc√°zar to beer tastings in the historic city center, Sevillatatis offers a curated selection of experiences tailored to every taste.

The system allows users to make reservations for activities throughout Seville. You can log in as an administrator with the username "admin" and password "admin", or as a user with the username "psangom" and password "Cesena12345". Additionally, you can choose to create a new user account.

I have used XAMP for the server environment, and I have attached the database used for the application in the folder.
