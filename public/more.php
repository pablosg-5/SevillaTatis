      <p>Seville, the capital of Andalusia, boasts a history spanning over 2,000 years. Founded as the Roman city of Hispalis, it later became a significant Moorish hub before being reclaimed during the Christian Reconquest. This blend of cultures has shaped the city's iconic landmarks, such as the Giralda, the Alc치zar, and the Archivo de Indias, all recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Seville is also the birthplace of flamenco, a passionate art form echoing its rich cultural heritage. The city's festivals, such as Holy Week (Semana Santa) and the April Fair (Feria de Abril), attract visitors worldwide, offering a unique glimpse into Andalusian traditions. From literature to architecture, Seville's cultural legacy remains deeply influential.</p>
