        <figcaption>The motto NO8DO is one of Seville's most iconic symbols, featured on its flag and coat of arms. Its most widely accepted interpretation is "It has not abandoned me," referencing the city’s loyalty to King Alfonso X the Wise during a rebellion led by his son, Sancho IV.The "8" in the motto represents a skein of yarn (a nod to weaving), forming a clever wordplay: "No-madeja-do." This motto symbolizes Seville’s pride and loyalty to its history and sovereignty. It serves as a reminder of the city’s resilient and faithful spirit.</figcaption>
