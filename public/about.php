    <article>
      <p>My name is Pablo S치nchez G칩mez, I was born in Seville, I study Computer Engineering in Seville, and I started my degree because I am passionate about technology and the world you can discover through it. I am currently doing a half-year Erasmus in Cesena, Italy. I chose this destination because I was very interested in Italy, its gastronomy, and culture, and I wanted to get to know the country more deeply.
        Sevillatatis comes from a project for the Web-related Technologies course, which gave me the freedom to choose any project I wanted. My goal is to spark my professors' interest in visiting Seville, just as I have visited and enjoyed their country and city. Additionally, I want to show a little bit of my love for Seville.</p>
